Welcome to the food delivery web application repository! This project is built with Next.js in the front-end, Sanity CMS for business data, and Firebase as a backend-as-a-service for user data and authentication. The application allows users to create an account, login, logout, reset their password, place orders, track order status, and make payments on delivery.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use and efficient solution for online food ordering and delivery. We aim to continually improve the app by implementing new features and addressing user feedback.

In the future, we plan to integrate the application with a payment gateway to enable secure online payments. We also hope to improve the order status update system to provide more timely and accurate information to our users. Additionally, we plan to build a recommendation system that suggests food items based on user order history.

We welcome contributions from developers who would like to collaborate on this project. Whether you are interested in adding new features, fixing bugs, or enhancing the user experience, we would love to have you on board.

Thank you for considering this project and we look forward to your feedback and contributions!
